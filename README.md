This React app is a guitar teaching game.

Produced with the excellent [fretboards library](https://github.com/txels/fretboards) created by Carles Barrob√©s

This app currently has 1 game : Guess the note.

I hope to add more games in my spare time.  

Feel free to contribute to this app.  I'm a newbie with React so would welcome feedback.

The app is deployed on [Vercel](https://fretty.now.sh/)
